Me vs AI

Jason Arbon challenged testers to compare their testing of the Google homepage to "AI"

My approach was to load the homepage, create an outline of the elements, and begin to iterate through each one. As I iterated I expanded my outline with new layers of features, some further test ideas to return to later, and even a bug. See the "My Results" file.

My approach is highly legible, explains the page, and provides a framework to fractally expand coverage in any given direction as desired/needed.

The AI approach was to list childishly simplisitic, unordered, unorganized, sometimes completely wrong, "test-cases" which would be utterly worthless to any tester. See "Ai First Answer."

I asked for more test cases, and the majority of these said to verify functionality which was actually wrong (I checked). See "AI Second Answer."

At this point I thought it would be worthless to go on, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt. I asked it to try again, but this time prioritizing the test cases and organizing them by page element. The results were the worst yet - the same wrong test cases, not prioritized, and they were organized incorrectly. See "AI Third Answer."
