Me vs AI

Jason Arbon challenged testers to compare their testing of the Google homepage to "AI"

My approach was to load the homepage, create an outline of the elements, and begin to iterate through each one. As I iterated I expanded my outline with new layers of features, some further test ideas to return to later, and even a bug.

My approach is highly legible, explains the page, and provides a framework to fractally expand coverage in any given direction as desired/needed.

The AI approach was to list childishly simplisitic, unordered, unorganized, sometimes completely wrong, "test-cases" which would be utterly worthless to any tester.
